            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>Gyve is a mobile application that encourages individuals to purchase charitable items as gifts. Honesty and transparency are highly valued factors when supporting charities, and most individuals give more if they had greater insight into the impact of their money. Gyve aims to address these concerns by empowering users to choose how they
                    allocate their funds. Furthermore, the app encourages people to contribute more often by donating on
                    behalf of friends on birthdays and special occasions.

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>Individuals can explore various causes and charities to customize their interests and tailor their
                    profiles. Each verified charity can build a wishlist with the items that they are in need of, which
                    are then presented to the user. While shopping for a friend, the app generates gift recommendations
                    based on multiple factors, including common interests and price range. After finding the perfect
                    present, users can schedule purchases with autobuy and automatically receive cashback when prices
                    decrease.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>With this project, it was essential to consider how to bridge the gap between our wants and our
                    actions. To encourage individuals to donate more frequently, I realized that it was essential to
                    increase transparency, simplicity, and connectedness. The app allows users to decide how they
                    contribute their money, leverages automation to deliver a straightforward experience, and connects
                    individuals with their friends and the greater community. It also presents the opportunity to
                    highlight local shops, partner with businesses, and engage with charities that require our support.

                <p>I was initially tasked with incorporating automation into a gift-giving mobile application, and I
                    performed competitive analyses to compare various platforms. The apps I explored allowed users to
                    input their birthdays and create wish lists, but I but found numerous existing products that
                    fulfilled the same purpose. Thus, I decided to pivot and tackle an underserved space to produce a
                    mobile application dedicated to donating charitable gifts.</p>
