Throughout the project, I collaborated with a design lead, developers, CMS admins, and QA analysts to scale design decisions and ensure consistency across the full process. I was in charge of maintaining the design system, directing developer hand-offs, and leading the front-end review process to align with brand standards, improve responsiveness, and drive leads.

                <p>The entire process was neither linear nor straightforward, and it allowed for significant learning opportunities along the way. At times, there were discrepancies between the initial Figma designs and how they turned out in development but we made it work! I constantly had to challenge what I knew, ask questions, and seek support from my teammates. It all helped me gain a better understanding of priorities and collaboration preferences – all of which shaped my perspective as a designer.

                <p>Prior to the Convex website migration, I have never had the opportunity to lead a project of this scale. While collaborating with other team members, I needed to make immediate calls on design decisions involving approaches, interactions, and visual improvements. I learned more about the website migration process, built trust with team members, and contributed to large-scale impact. As a Junior, it initially took a moment to solidify my role as the main point of contact, but eventually my teammates trusted me to make nearly all of the design decisions. That felt like a big win!
