                <p>I supported the Design Lead with creating a comprehensive library of components, ensuring they were intuitive for designers and developers.

I also responded to dev inquiries, documented any design issues, and collaborated with other team members to polish the website.</p>

                <p>Before the Convex website migration, I hadn’t had the opportunity to lead a project of this scale. While collaborating with other team members, there were various instances in which I needed to make immediate calls on design decisions involving approaches, interactions, and visual improvements. I learned more about the website migration process, developed and shared trust with team members, and contributed to large-scale impact. As a Junior, it initially took a moment to solidify my role as the main point of contact. Eventually, my teammates trusted me to make decisions without involving the Design Lead. That felt like a big win!

                <p>The entire process was neither linear nor straightforward, and it allowed for significant learning opportunities along the way. At times, there were discrepancies between the initial Figma designs and how they turned out in development, but we still made it work! I constantly had to challenge what I knew, ask tons of questions, and seek support from my teammates. It all helped me better understand their roles, what should be prioritized, and their collaboration preferences – which all shaped my perspective as a designer.
