                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Around the globe, freshly brewed soup is universally regarded as comfort food and is often
                    reminiscent of the familiar feeling of home. Contrarily, purchased for cooking convenience and
                    efficiency, instant soup does not carry the same associations as the original products.</p>

                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>While considering the consoling nature of soup, Just Like Home soup had been created to introduce
                    young adults with busy schedules to a few of the many vibrant flavours across the world. The visual
                    designs reflect historically significant buildings within the flavour’s respective country,
                    indicating that “home” can be anywhere—as it is a feeling, rather than a geographical location. </p>

                        Home soup elevates an everyday product to encourage consumers to expand their

                    top, so the consumer can open the box without making a mess. The final dimensions were 2.2cm L x

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>The first version features rough sketches of information placement, and demonstrates how the package
                    is meant to open for revealing the interior containers. The bottom panel is folded to allow
                    sufficient spacing between the smaller packages, and the open window reveals the contents inside.

            <div>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>The hand-drawn illustrations on the front panel were disconnected from the vector style of the
                    interior graphic, and the container itself felt too rigid. Moreover, I had dedicated space for a
                    background illustration and interior infographic, but it felt cluttered and took away from the main
                    components.</p>

                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>To address these issues, I planned to redraw the front panel to better coordinate with the interior
                    containers, explore different shapes for the window, and dedicate more empty space to prevent
                    overwhelming consumers.</p>

                <p>The second iteration has 5 designed panels—in which the front includes an illustration and basic
                    product information, the sides present nutrition facts, the back shows directions and ingredients,
                    and the top features simple branding.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>I created side tabs to add improved mechanisms to keep the front panel closed, but they disrupted the
                    aesthetics of the container. The directions and nutrition facts were also not laid out in visually
                    appealing ways.</p>

                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>I planned to eliminate the side tabs of the exterior container and instead, add more structure to the
                    front panel by increasing the depth of the top fold. More space surrounding the nutrition and
                    further organization of the directions would improve the appearance of the side and back panels.</p>

                <p>Next, I created three sets of containers to represent flavours from different countries. Each set
                    featured three separate servings, each with their own variation of the same colour scheme. I also
                    began to explore photography and prop options.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>The colour schemes were light and playful, but did not effectively target the established demographic of
                    young adults. It was also important to demonstrate the purpose of the product through the photoshoot
                    props.</p>

                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>I recognized that I had to perform further research to conceptualize a more suitable colour scheme
                    for the packaging. To improve the photos, I had to show the product and use props that would be more
                    reminiscent of soup.</p>

                <p>Taking inspiration from the soup flavours, I redesigned the colour scheme to be more fitting of the
